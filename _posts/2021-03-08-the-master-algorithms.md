# The Master Algorithm
## How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World

## Abstract

Algorithms increasingly run our lives. They find books, movies, jobs, and dates for us, manage our investments, and discover new drugs. In the world's top research labs and universities, the race is on to invent the ultimate learning algorithm: one capable of discovering any knowledge from data, and doing anything we want, before we even ask. Peek inside the learning machines that power Google, Amazon, and your smartphone, hear about the blueprint for the future universal learner, and see what the master algorithm means for the future of business, science, and society.
