# What is Platform Engineering?

## Abstract

Platform engineering is a methodology and process for designing, building, operating, and managing complex software systems. It involves using various technology stacks, tools, methodologies, infrastructure, and processes to ensure and improve the stability, performance, scalability, security, and resilience of a system. This allows organizations to innovate faster.

Let's consider an example of a platform engineering in the context of a large-scale e-commerce platform. Here's how a company might use platform engineering to design their system:

1. **Microservices Architecture**: The company might apply microservices architecture to develop and deploy functionality independently.
2. **Service Mesh and API Gateway**: They might use a service mesh and an API gateway to manage communication and data exchange between various services.
3. **Cloud-Native Technologies**: The company might use cloud-native technologies to increase scalability and availability while automating fault detection and recovery.
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: They might build a CI/CD pipeline to manage automated releases and deployment in real-time.
5. **Monitoring and Logging System**: The company might create a monitoring and logging system to continually monitor system performance and stability and address issues quickly.

By applying platform engineering in this manner, the company can innovate faster, enhance customer experience, and increase business outcomes.
