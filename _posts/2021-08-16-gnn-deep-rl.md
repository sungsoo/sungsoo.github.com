# Graph Neural Networks and Applications to Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Abstract

Many interesting problems involve processing information that's best represented by graphs. To that end, prior work has introduced *Graph Neural Networks* (GNNs) that bring the powerful capabilities of deep learning to graphical inputs. In this talk, I will provide an overview of various GNN techniques, including GCNs, as well as applications seen in recent research in *Deep Reinforcement Learning* (RL). I will go in depth on using graphs to represent common-sense, prior knowledge about the world, and how that can be leveraged for faster learning.
