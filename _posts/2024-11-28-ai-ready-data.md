# AI-Ready Data. What Does That Mean!?

## Abstract

Everyone wants to take advantage of AI but to truly do so, the data must be made ready for use. Every data team has been asked to make their data ready for use by AI. But what does that actually look like in practice? How do you know if you're there? And how do you get there if you're not? This session will explore how AI is changing data management, share best practices when using AI for data management, and provide a glimpse into the future of how data consumption might look in 5 years.
