# Controlling Traffic with Reinforcement Learning

## Abstract

Finally a good real-life use case for *Reinforcement Learning* (RL): traffic control! 
In this talk I will show you how we hooked up traffic simulation software to Python and how we built our own custom gym environment to run RL experiments with keras-rl for a simple 4-way intersection.

## Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control Validated in Real-Time Real World Traffic

We implemented *distributed Q-Learning* based traffic signal control to optimize vehicles, pedestrians, and neighborhood traffic. Simulations of any cities with real-world map and traffic data show significant performance gains.
