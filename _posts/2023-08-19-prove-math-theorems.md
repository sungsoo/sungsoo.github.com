# 9 tips to help you PROVE MATH THEOREMS


## Abstract

How can you prove math theorems? How do you begin? What are the types of logical arguments you can use? How do you get unstuck when you don't know what to do? In this video i'm going to walk through a series of tips and tricks to help you prove mathematical theorems. We'll talk about the logical structure, and contrast proof methods like direct, contrapositive, contradiction and counterexample. I'll give you concrete template to work from assumptions, definitions of assumptions, manipulations, definition of conclusion and finally the conclusion. And then i'll talk about broader tips for getting yourself unstuck.

The four main types of proof you need to be familiar with in A-level mathematics:

- proof by deduction
- proof by exhaustion
- proof by counter-example
- proof by contradiction
