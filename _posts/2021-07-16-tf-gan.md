# Generative Adversarial Networks and TF-GAN

In this session of Machine Learning Tech Talks, Research Engineer Joel Shor will discuss a very cool development and technique in machine learning called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and a library that offers open source to help make training and evaluating GANs easier.
