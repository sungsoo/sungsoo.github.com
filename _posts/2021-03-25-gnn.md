# Graph Neural Networks

## Abstract
**Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** recently emerged to a powerful approach for representation learning on relational data such as social networks, molecular graphs or geometry. Similar to the concepts of *convolutional* and *pooling* layers on regular domains, GNNs are able to (*hierarchically*) extract localized embeddings by passing, transforming, and aggregating information between nodes.  In this lecture, I will provide a broad overview of this highly active research field, and will cover relevant topics such as scalability and applications based on GNNs. In a hands-on session, you will implement and train GNNs from scratch using the PyTorch Geometric library [1]. You will learn how to apply GNNs to your own problems and how PyTorch Geometric enables high GPU throughput on highly sparse and irregular data of varying size.
