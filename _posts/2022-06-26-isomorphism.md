# Isomorphism Using Adjacency Matrix



## Abstract

An *isomorphism* from a graph *G* to a graph *H* is a bijection from the vertex set of *G* to the vertex set of *H* such that adjacency and non-adjacency are preserved.  However, finding such a mapping is also equivalent to find a *permutation matrix P* such that *A = PBP^T* where *A* and *B* are the adjacency matrices of *G* and *H* respectively.  We demonstrate how this works with an example.
