## Abstract

Accurate traffic prediction is essential to many real-world applications, e.g., assist route planning, guide vehicle dispatching, and mitigate traffic congestion. However, this problem is challenging due to the complicated and *dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies* between different regions in the road network. In the talk, I will emphasis on how new advances in deep learning can contribute to spatiotemporal data-based urban traffic prediction. Meanwhile, I will briefly introduce my previous works regarding "smart motorway" management measures and crash data mining.
