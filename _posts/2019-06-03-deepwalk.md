# DeepWalk: Turning Graphs Into Features via Network Embeddings

## Abstract

* Dr. Steven Skiena, Stony Brook University
* Michael Hunger, Neo4j

*Random walk algorithms* help better model real-world scenarios, and when applied to graphs, can significantly improve machine learning. Learn how the Deepwalk supervised learning algorithm transfers deep learning techniques from natural language processing to network analysis, and explore the motivations behind *graph-enhanced machine learning*.
