This talk will introduce recent algorithms for quantum Gibbs samplers. I will start by describing the frameworks for classical discrete-time and continuous-time Markov chains, with an emphasis on the classical Metropolis algorithm. I will discuss Lindbladians, the generalization of continuous classical Markov chains to the quantum setting. I will cover different methods for boosting accuracy in phase estimation. Finally, using these building blocks, I will step through several algorithms for quantum Gibbs samplers.
