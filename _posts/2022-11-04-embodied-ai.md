## Abstract

Generalization in embodied intelligence, such as in robotics, requires interactive learning across families of tasks is essential for discovering efficient representation and inference mechanisms. Concurrent systems need a lot of hand-holding to even learn a single cognitive concept or a dexterous skill, say "open a door", let alone generalizing to new windows and cupboards! This is far from our vision of everyday robots! would require a broader concept of generalization and continual update of representations. This study of the science of embodied AI opens three key questions: (a) Representational biases & Causal inference for interactive decision making, (b) Perceptual representations learned by and for interaction, (c) Systems and abstractions for scalable learning. This talk will focus on decision-making uncovering the many facets of inductive biases in off-policy reinforcement learning in robotics. I will introduce **C-Learning** to trade off-speed and reliability instead of vanilla Q-Learning. Then I will talk about the discovery of latent causal structure to improve sample efficiency. Moving on from skills, we will describe task graphs for hierarchically structured tasks for manipulation. I will present how to scale structured learning in robot manipulation with Roboturk, and finally, prescribe a practical algorithm for deployment with safety constraints. Taking a step back, I will end with notions of structure in Embodied AI for both perception and decision making.
