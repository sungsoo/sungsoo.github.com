# Network Diffusion & Contagion

### Abstract
How something will spread across a network is a key question we will be interested in when analyzing many different networks, more formally we call this spreading on a network propagation or diffusion, this process of *diffusion* and is defined by a number of different parameters that we will be exploring in this module.

## Social Network Diffusion

### Abstract
The study of *network diffusion* tries to capture the underlying mechanism of how events propagate through a complex network, whether the subject of interest is a virus spreading through some population, the spreading of some social movement, some new fashion or innovation or it may be a marketing message through an online social network. In this video we will be covering some of the primary considerations when looking at the process of diffusion including; how will the structure of the network effect that process? How fast will it spread, for example will we get tipping points? how can we enable or constrain this process?
