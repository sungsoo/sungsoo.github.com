# Robust Distortion-free Watermarks for Language Models

* A Google TechTalk, presented by John Thickstun, 2024-07-02


## Abstract

A Google Algorithms Seminar.  ABSTRACT: We describe a protocol for planting a watermark into text generated by an autoregressive language model (LM) that is robust to edits and does not change the distribution of generated text. We generate watermarked text by controlling the source of randomness--using a secret watermark key--that the LM decoder uses to convert probabilities of text into samples. To detect the watermark, any party who knows the key can test for statistical correlations between a snippet of text and the watermark key; meanwhile, our watermark is provably undetectable by anyone who does not know the watermark key. We instantiate our watermarking protocol with two alternative decoders: inverse transform sampling and Gumbel argmax sampling. We apply these watermarks to the OPT-1.3B, LLaMA 7B, and instruction-tuned Alpaca 7B LMs to experimentally validate their statistical power and robustness to various paraphrasing attacks.
