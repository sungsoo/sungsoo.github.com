# Spatial, High Dimensional, Temporal Data Indexing and Querying


* Spatial data
   - quad trees
   - R-trees (using MBRs - minimum boundary rectangles)
      When it comes to querying R-trees its the same as quadtrees dont query the point in relation to   the points in the database but the BUCKETS (MBRs) as indices

* High dimensional data
   - Skylines
   - Pyramids

* Temporal data
   - TPR-trees

* Route Planning
