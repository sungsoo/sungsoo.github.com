## Abstract

Content-based image retrieval is one of the most essential techniques used for interacting with visual collections. Although significant progress has been made in the last decade, existing technologies have only been evaluated on a standard benchmark such as the Oxford dataset, which mainly consists of building images. There has not been enough discussion about how to create a practical and large-scale visual search system for real-world applications, such as recommendation for shopping items in online marketplaces or re-identification for pedestrians in a security scenario.
