## Abstract

Started by Google a couple of years ago, Kubeflow is an end-to-end MLOps platform for AI at scale. Canonical has its own distribution, Charmed Kubeflow, which addresses the entire machine-learning lifecycle. Charmed Kubeflow is a suite of tools, such as Notebooks for training, Pipeline for automation, Katib for hyperparameter tuning or KServe for model serving and more. Charmed Kubeflow benefits from a wide range of integrations with other tools such as MLFlow, Spark, Grafana or Prometheus.

MLFLow on the other hand celebrated 10 million downloads last year. Itâ€™s a very popular solution when it comes to machine learning. Although it started initially with a core function, the tool has nowadays four conceptions that include model registry or experiment tracking.

So, which one should you choose for Machine Learning Operations?

Join us for a Kubeflow vs MLFLow panel discussion with Maciej Mazur, AI/ML Principal Engineer at Canonical, and Kimonas Sotirchos - Kubeflow Community Working Group Lead and Engineering Manager at Canonical.

The discussion will cover:

- Production-grade MLOps
- Open-source MLOps
- Community-driven ML tooling
- Kubeflow vs MLFlow; Pros and Cons
