## Abstract

In this video, I introduce TorchServe, an open-source model serving library for PyTorch jointly developed by AWS and Facebook. I provide a quick look at what it is, how it works, it's key capabilities and a live demo on how use TorchServe. The demo covers how to start torchserve, how to register and unregister models, query models, how to scale up and down workers and submit inference requests.
