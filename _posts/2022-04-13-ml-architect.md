# Tips for Thinking Like a Machine Learning Architect

## Abstract

A Machine Learning Architect is the bridge between the potential of machine learning, and a good decision about if and where to invest in it.

I'll give you three tips for thinking like a machine learning architect, including: 

1) Is machine learning the right way to solve the problem?
2) How do machine learning systems integrate with exiting systems?
3) What is the cost to build and run the ML system over time?

Developing the skill to think like a machine learning architect can be valuable to anyone involved in machine learning systems, not just the machine learning scientist. So If youâ€™re a machine learning professional, a machine learning engineer, a data scientist, an engineering manager, a technical program manager, or even a leader afraid of getting left behind, check this out.
