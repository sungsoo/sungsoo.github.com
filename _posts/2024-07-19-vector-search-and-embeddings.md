# Vector Search and Embeddings in Organizations : Harnessing Language Models and Vector Indexing


## Abstract


Join Nils Reimers (leading state-of-the-art vector search methods using transformer networks at Cohere), and Etienne Dilocker (Co-Founder and CTO of @Weaviate, an open-source vector database) for this NLP Jumpstart session.

They will take you through the triple vector journey of vector search, embeddings, and indexing. You will learn how organizations can take advantage of large language models (LLMs) for their search, NLP tasks, and generative needs. Then they will answer how LLMs coupled with vector databases will help you take it all to production in public (or hybrid) managed cloud environments or your local setup. 

By the end of this session, you will have a clear understanding of LLMs and vector databases, how they work together, and how to take your search NLP tasks to production.
