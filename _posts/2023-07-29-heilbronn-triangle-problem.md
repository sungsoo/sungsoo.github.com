# A New Upper Bound for the Heilbronn Triangle Problem


## Abstract
We discuss a new upper bound for the Heilbronn triangle problem, showing that for sufficiently
large $n$ in every configuration of $n$ points chosen inside a unit square there exists a triangle
of area less than $n^{-8/7-1/2000}$. This is joint work with Alex Cohen and Dmitrii Zakharov.
