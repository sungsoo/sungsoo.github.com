# Vector Database Fundamentals

ANNOY stands for Approximate Nearest Neighbors, Oh Yeah. It's a vector search algorithm that came out of Spotify. It is a rougher version of IVF. It uses hyperplanes to divide the space in half between two points, and does this over and over again. When we query, we are essentially querying a binary tree. 

Whether you're new to Semantic Similarity Search and Vector Databases or considering its adoption for your projects, this video will provide valuable insights into its capabilities and best practices for usage. The next set of videos will walk you through all you need to know about Vector Search, how to get started and prepare you for some cool advanced topics!
