# RAG with a Neo4j Knowledge Graph: How it Works and How to Set It Up


## Abstract

In this video, Philipp Brunenberg explains how RAG (retrieval augmented generation) with a Neo4j Knowledge Graph works and how we can set it up on your laptop. He’ll also give a brief introduction on how we can customize the code from the Gen-AI Stack.

We’ll cover:

* What is RAG?
* How does RAG with a Neo4j Knowledge Graph work?
* What are the benefits of using RAG & Neo4j?
* How can I set up RAG with Neo4j using a Llama2 model and the GenAI Stack?
