# Atlan AI for Documentation -- LIVE Demo 


## Abstract

1. No more manual documentation

By understanding the name, schema, and lineage context of your data asset, Atlan AI generates a first draft of descriptions and READMEs. All you have to do is review, edit, and publish.

2. Ensure business definitions are documented

Align everyone in your organization by ensuring every business metric and KPI has auto-generated documentation, reviewed and edit for business context by data stewards.

3. Document 100s of data assets in minutes

If you’ve just started your data governance journey, you’re bound to have a backlog of data assets with missing documentation. Document all that tribal knowledge in minutes by pairing Playbooks and Atlan AI.
