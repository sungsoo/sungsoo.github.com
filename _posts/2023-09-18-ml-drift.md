# ML Drift; Identifying Issues Before You Have a Problem


## Abstract

Over time, our AI predictions degrade. Full Stop.

Whether it’s concept drift, where the relationships of our data to what we’re trying to predict has changed, or data drift, where our production data no longer resembles the historical training data, identifying meaningful machine learning drift versus spurious or acceptable drift is tedious.

In this 15 minute overview you’ll learn about the different types of ML drift and how to monitor for the early warning signs. We’ll also cover strategies to intervene before “drift” impacts the bottom line.
