# On Laplacian Eigenmaps for Dimensionality Reduction

## Abstract

The aim of this talk is to describe the non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm based on spectral techniques introduced in \cite{BN2003}. This approach has its foundation on the spectral analysis of graph Laplacian. The motivation of the construction comes from the role of the continuous limit, the Laplace-Beltrami operator, in providing an optimal embedding for manifolds.
