# Bayesian Causal Inference & Propensity Scores  

## Abstract
 In this webinar, we will explore the world of causal inference and how propensity scores can be a powerful tool. Learn how to estimate propensity scores and use them to tackle selection bias in your analysis.

## 🔍 Agenda
- Propensity Score Estimation: Discover how to calculate propensity scores and their significance in causal analysis. 📊
- Bayesian Analyst's Perspective: See how propensity score weighting can enrich your Bayesian models with valuable information. 🧮
- Machine Learning & Causal Inference: Explore the application of propensity scores in debiasing machine learning for causal inference. 🤖
- Contrast: We'll highlight the differences between non-parametric BART models and simpler regression models in estimating propensity scores and causal effects. 

## 📈 Takeaways
- Propensity scores are useful in observational data to evaluate the effect of a treatment.
- Different weighting schemes, such as raw inverse weighting and doubly robust methods, can be used with propensity scores.
- Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) models offer flexibility in modeling propensity scores.
- Extreme propensity scores can be dealt with by removing individuals or using matching algorithms.
- Propensity scores can be used in regression modeling to estimate treatment effects. Propensity score adjustment, doubly robust estimation, and mediation analysis are methods used in causal inference.
- Beliefs and assumptions about the data generating process underlie these methodologies.
- It is important to be Bayesian in our approach to causal inference.
- Non-parametric estimation can help address miscalibration and overfitting risks.
- Understanding the causal structure and considering mediation effects are crucial in causal inference.

## 📜 Webinar Structure
- Non-parametric Approaches: We'll showcase various non-parametric methods for estimating causal effects. Some are spot-on, while others can mislead you. ⚙️
- Propensity Scores in Selection Effect Bias: Learn how to apply propensity scores to tackle selection bias head-on. 🛡️
- Debiased/Double ML for ATE Estimation: Discover how to use Debiased/Double Machine Learning to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE). 📈
- Mediation Analysis: Dive into mediation analysis and estimate Direct and Indirect Effects. 🔄
