## Time Series Forecasting using Statistical and Machine Learning Models

### Abstract

Time series data is ubiquitous, and time series modeling techniques are data scientists' essential tools. This presentation compares *Vector Autoregressive* (VAR) model, which is one of the most important class of multivariate time series statistical models, and neural network-based techniques, which has received a lot of attention in the data science community in the past few years.
