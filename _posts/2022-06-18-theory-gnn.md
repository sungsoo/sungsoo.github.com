## Abstract
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), neural network architectures targeted to learning representations of graphs, have become a popular learning model for prediction tasks on nodes, graphs and configurations of points, with wide success in practice. This article summarizes a selection of the emerging theoretical results on approximation and learning properties of widely used message passing GNNs and higher-order GNNs, focusing on representation, generalization and extrapolation. Along the way, it summarizes mathematical connections.
