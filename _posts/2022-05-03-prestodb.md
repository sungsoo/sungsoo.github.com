# What is PrestoDB?

## Abstract
Presto is a widely adopted federated SQL engine for federated querying across multiple data sources. With Presto, you can perform ad hoc querying of data in place. For today’s “data hacker”, Presto helps solve challenges around time to discovery and the amount of time it takes to do ad hoc analysis.

In Level 101, you’ll get an overview of Presto, including:

- A high level overview of Presto & most common use cases
- The problems it solves and why you should use it
- A live, hands-on demo on getting Presto running on Docker
- Real world example: How Twitter uses Presto at scale
