# Permutation Equivariance of Graph Filters

## Abstract

In this lecture we discuss the concept of permutation equivariance for graph filters. We start introducing the basic notions of permutation and later state formally permutation equivariance for matrix operators associated to graph filters. We show formally why graph filters are permutation equivariant and what are the implications of this fact in terms of the labelings of the information that is being processed.
