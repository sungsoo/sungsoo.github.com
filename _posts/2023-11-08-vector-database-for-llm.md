# Vector Database for Large Language Models in Production

* Speaker: Sam Partee, Principal Applied AI Engineer, Redis 

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have lowered the bar for getting a product to market however they are "not (always) large enough" in that they don't always contain all the information they need to solve a certain task.
This is where Vector Databases come in!

In this talk Sam Partee, Principal Applied AI Engineer at Redis covers topics such as:
Vector Embeddings, Vector Similarity Search, what is a Vector Database, some common design patterns using Vector Databases and LLMs, what to consider when building a system using Vector Databases and some example uses cases for Vector Databases.
