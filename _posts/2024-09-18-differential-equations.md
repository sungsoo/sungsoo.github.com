## ABSTRACT 
This video presents an overview lecture for a new series on Differential Equations & Dynamical Systems.  Dynamical systems are differential equations that describe any system that changes in time.  Applications include fluid dynamics, elasticity and vibrations, weather and climate systems, epidemiology, biomechanics, space mission design, and control theory.  

I assume that students have taken some calculus (but might not remember it) and are interested in modeling the real world.
