## Abstract
Optimizing recommendations for a single objective, e.g., prediction accuracy, may be too limiting in certain applications. Instead, it is often important not only to consider multiple quality factors of recommendations, e.g., diversity, but to also take the perspectives of multiple stakeholders into account. In this talk, we will review different approaches from the literature that aim to consider multiple objectives in the recommendation process. Furthermore, we will outline open challenges and future directions in this area.
