## Abstract
 
We are glad to invite Prof. Marinka Zitnik from Harvard University to give a lecture on Graph Neural Networks in Computational Biology. In this lecture, Prof. Marinka gives an overview of why graph learning techniques can greatly help with computational biology research. Concretely, this talk covers 3 exemplar use cases: (1) Discovering safe drug-drug combinations via multi-relational link prediction on heterogenous knowledge graphs; (2) Classify patient outcomes and diseases via learning subgraph embeddings; and (3) Learning effective disease treatments through few-shot learning for graphs.
