# Geoffrey Hinton in conversation with Fei-Fei Li — Responsible AI development

## Abstract


U of T Professor Emeritus Geoffrey Hinton is joined by Stanford University Professor Fei-Fei Li for a special talk on ethical AI, presented by Radical Ventures and hosted by the University of Toronto. They address the ethical considerations of AI development and its advancement — as well as its potential to solve some of the world’s most pressing problems. They also discuss their collaboration on one of the most important milestones in the history of modern AI. 

Since leaving Google in May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton, known as the “godfather of AI,” has become vocal about the existential risks posed by rapid advancements in artificial intelligence. Li is co-director of Stanford’s Human-Centered AI Institute. She agrees with Hinton on the threat and emphasizes the need to invest in public institutions to help guide the technology’s future.
