# Causality Upside Down

## Abstract

When we think about causal modeling, we often focus on (critically important) assumptions necessary to make valid causal inferences. The value of this perspective is hard to overestimate. At the same time, the true goal of applied causal inference is to improve our decision-making rather than just meet causal assumptions. In this talk, we will take a look at a set of methods that allow us to make causal inferences under violated assumptions. Although some, if not all, of these methods might not lead to inferences as precise as we’d like, they can help us solve our real problem – making better decisions.
