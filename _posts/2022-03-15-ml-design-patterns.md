## Abstract

If you're looking for a great resource to improve your practical ML skills, we highly recommend the book "Machine Learning Design Patterns". This book provides clear solutions to common challenges in data preparation, model building and MLOps.

Wouldn't it be great if we can make learning a bit more social?
We will organize two sessions about this book to help you digest it even better :-).

For the first session we are very happy to announce that none other than the author himself (Lak) will be joining to give a presentation about the book and to answer your questions directly.
