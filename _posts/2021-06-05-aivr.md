## Abstract

Let's look past today's technologies and imagine the future they are enabling. On the VR side, we'll have circuitry intimately connected to our bodies and brains, augmenting or even replacing sensory data, perceptions, thoughts, and memories. On the AI side, we'll be able to synthesize this information with such fidelity and coherence that we will be unable to distinguish it from objective sources. What happens when these technologies merge? Much that is good, and much that is not. In this talk we discuss both types of changes, and offer some steps for consciously building a future we would want to live in.
