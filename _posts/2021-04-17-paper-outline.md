Write your research paper outline 
=================================


![](http://www.languageediting.com/wp-content/uploads/Research-paper-outline-300x240.jpg)

Publishing papers is a necessary evil for a postgraduate student doing a
research doctorate. But as you may have discovered by now, writing your
first research paper for a peer-reviewed journal is an uphill marathon.

"Good writing is bad writing well edited", wrote innovator Kevin Ashton
in his book *How to Fly a Horse*. But before you can edit your paper,
you need to put pen to paper, or cursor to screen, and start writing
your first draft.

As few things are more daunting for a writer than staring at a blank
page, it’s a good idea to use an outline. If your research paper were a
building, the outline would be its architectural plan. You can use a
research paper outline to design your paper and organize its content in
logical sections. As a bonus, you’ll avoid writer’s block, which you
tend to get if you stare at an empty page for hours.

Research paper outline example
------------------------------

Here is an example of a scientific
paper outline. You can rename
the sections to make them more descriptive, though the journal editor
may ask you to leave some of
them ([Introduction](http://www.languageediting.com/publishing-economics-papers-advice-from-the-experts/),
Conclusion,
[Abstract](http://www.languageediting.com/publishing-economics-papers-advice-from-the-experts/))
unchanged.

### **Abstract**

-   Background—one sentence to give context
-   Aim or research question
-   Summary of findings
-   Results
-   Conclusion
-   Implications/recommendations

### **Introduction**

-   Background and recent research relevant to your topic
-   Gap/conflict in current knowledge
-   Hypothesis/question/aim of the study and WHY it is new
-   Proposed solution and your plan to find it
-   NO results, NO implications

### **Data and methods**

-   The "recipe" for your study to allow your research to be replicated.
    Should answer the questions
    -   Who?
    -   What?
    -   When?
    -   Where?
    -   How?
    -   Why?
-   Data
-   Study design
-   Data analysis

### **Results (or results and discussion)**

-   Key findings
-   Context
-   What do the results mean, and why should the reader care?
-   Anticipate criticism—what are the weak parts of your
    results/methods?
-   What’s next?
-   Big-picture implications of findings

### **Conclusion**

-   Summary of findings
-   Restate the message of the paper
-   Implications, recommendation
-   NO discussion, NO detailed results

This research paper outline is just a template, and you need to modify
it so it fits your paper. Compare it with similar papers in the journal
you want to publish. Also, read the journal’s guidelines for authors, as
they might specify the desired manuscript format and structure for a
research paper.

Turning the research paper outline into a paper
-----------------------------------------------

When writing the first draft of your [research
paper](http://www.languageediting.com/why-does-it-take-so-long-to-write-a-journal-paper/),
it helps to prepare the tables and figures first. Though this may sound
counterintuitive, having the figures and tables in front of you as you
write helps you get a clear view of your findings. It’s pointless to
create professional figures at this stage, but they should be complete.
So, label the axes of your graphics, and add units of measurement to
your tables.

Once you have your figures and tables at hand, start writing the
sections of your paper in this order: **results**, **data and methods**,
**introduction**, **discussion**, **conclusion**, and—save the best for
last—**abstract**.

If your paper is not open-access, the
[abstract](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/essays/abstract.html) will
be the only section visible to non-subscribers, and even those who have
access to the full paper may not read anything else apart from the
abstract. To write a good abstract, you need to have a clear idea of the
message of your paper and the importance of your results. This is the
reason you should write your abstract at the end.

Then, when your first draft is complete, you can start thinking about a
[good
title](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/12/the_best_funny_clever_or_offensive_science_paper_titles.html?via=gdpr-consent)
that highlights the most important findings of your study.

Beyond the first draft: How to write a research paper
-----------------------------------------------------

Give yourself a pat on the back for completing the first draft. Get
feedback from your co-authors. Revise. Get feedback again. Revise.
Repeat as necessary. Finalize your figures and tables. Format the
references. Edit the paper. Edit it again. Proofread. Submit. Fingers
crossed!
