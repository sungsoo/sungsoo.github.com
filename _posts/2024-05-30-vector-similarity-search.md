# Vector Similarity Search & Indexing Methods


## Abstract

Vector similarity search utilizes deep learning methods and ANN (approximate nearest neighbor) algorithms to provide faster, more accurate search capable of processing trillion-scale unstructured datasets. In this talk, our speaker- Dr.Yi will cover how various index types can be used in Milvus to accelerate vector similarity search on large datasets.
