Geometric Deep Learning
===

Geometric Deep Learning is able to draw insights from *graph data*. That includes social networks, sensor networks, the entire Internet, and even 3D Objects (if we consider point cloud data to be a graph). I'll explain how it works via a demo of me using a graph convolutional network to classify people by their interest in sports teams as well as a 3D object classification demo. At its core, it comes down to being able to learn from non-Euclidean data. Euclid's laws help define certain types of data, so I'll cover some geometry background as well. Enjoy!
