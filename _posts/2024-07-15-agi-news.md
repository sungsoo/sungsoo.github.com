# AI Shocks Again: AGI Levels by OpenAI, Grok 2 and Neuralink Update, Miss AI 2024 & More!

## Abstract 
OpenAI is developing a five-level roadmap towards achieving human-level artificial intelligence (AGI), currently advancing to the second level, which focuses on problem-solving capabilities. Meanwhile, Elon Musk has announced updates on Grok 2, a witty AI tool for X platform users, and on Neuralink's brain chips aimed at enhancing human capabilities. Additionally, major tech companies like Samsung and Amazon are enhancing their AI offerings, with Samsung upgrading Bixby and Amazon AWS launching new generative AI tools, signaling rapid growth and competition in the AI sector.
