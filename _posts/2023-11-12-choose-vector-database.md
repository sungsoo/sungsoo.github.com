# How to Choose a Vector Database



## Abstract

Noé Achache of Sicara joins us to present How to Choose a Vector Database in 2023.  Noé explores the evolving landscape of vector databases in the context of rising interest in LLMs and Generative AI. He offers a comparison of various vector databases, advising readers on choosing between integrated vector search tools like PGVector and knn search for existing databases versus dedicated vector databases such as Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, Milvus, and ChromaDB, for cost and latency concerns.

The discussion covers indexing algorithms, emphasizing HNSW and IVF, followed by an in-depth comparison of the vector databases. Finally, a practical example of using a vector database with DVC will be shown, to iterate on your vectors while using the same stack as in your production pipeline.

At the end of the presentation, you should have more clarity on selecting the right vector database based on individual requirements and technical infrastructure.
