## Abstract

As development moves toward cloud-native application development using containerized and distributed services, it has become important for developers to understand how these services work together. One of the key tools that help developers and organizations monitor, connect, and secure their microservices without requiring changes to application code is the open-source service mesh called Istio. In this talk, I'll give you a high-level overview of the Istio service mesh. You'll learn what service mesh is and what it offers in terms of features and functionality.
