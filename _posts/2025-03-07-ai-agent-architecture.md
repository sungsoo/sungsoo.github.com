## Abstract

Join us for an insightful webinar featuring Jay van Zyl from ecosystem.Ai as we explore the Ecogentic approach to AI agents. This session delves into the various frameworks and architectures used to implement AI-driven automation across multiple disciplines, including making money, saving money, and protecting money. 

Jay will provide an overview of key concepts, architectures, and the importance of reliable agent execution. The discussion also covers practical implementations, industry use cases, and a demonstration of the Ecogentic Framework in action.
