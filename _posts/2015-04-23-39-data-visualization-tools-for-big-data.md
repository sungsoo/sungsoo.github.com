# 39 Data Visualization Tools for Big Data

## Big Data is more valuable when visualized and analyzed

Data visualizations are everywhere today. From creating a visual
representation of data points to impress potential investors, report on
progress, or even visualize concepts for customer segments, data
visualizations are a valuable tool in a variety of settings. When it
comes to big data, weak tools with basic features don’t cut it. The
following 39 tools (listed in no particular order) are some of the best,
most comprehensive, sophisticated-yet-flexible visualization tools
available — and all are capable of handling big data.

Many of these tools are Open-Source, free applications that can be used
in conjunction with one another or with your existing design
applications, using JavaScript, JSON, SVG, Python, HTML5 or
drag-and-drop functionality with no programming required at all. Others
are comprehensive business intelligence platforms capable of
sophisticated data analysis and reporting, complete with a multitude of
ways to visualize your data. Whether you need to analyze data and
determine the best ways to present it to clients or partners, or you
have a visual layout in mind and need a tool to bring your concept to
life — there’s a tool on this list to serve your needs.
