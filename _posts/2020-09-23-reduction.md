# Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction

* Speaker: Christian Bueno, University of California, Santa Barbara


## Abstract
Working with lower dimensional representations of data can be valuable for simplifying models, removing noise, and visualization. When data is distributed in *geometrically* complicated ways, tools such as PCA can quickly run into limitations due to their *linear nature*. 
In this tutorial, we will dive into dimension reduction for when data is distributed in ways that have *nontrivial topology* and *curvature*. 
We'll build up our understanding of these approaches alongside classical ideas from *topology* and *differential geometry* and consider their interplay. Finally, we will explore some relationships between *nonlinear dimension reduction* and *stochastic dynamics*.
