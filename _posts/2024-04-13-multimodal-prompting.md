# Multimodal Prompting with a 44-minute Movie

## Abstract

This is a demo of long context understanding, an experimental feature in our newest model, Gemini 1.5 Pro using a 44-minute silent Buster Keaton movie, Sherlock Jr., and a series of multimodal prompts.  

This demo is a continuous recording of a live model interaction. Sequences have been shortened with response times shown. 

Token count details: The input video (696,161 tokens) and image (256 tokens) total 696,417 tokens. The text inputs add additional tokens into the prompt, yielding the 696,538 token total shown in the interface.
