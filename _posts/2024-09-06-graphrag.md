# GraphRAG; The Marriage of Knowledge Graphs and RAG


## Abstract

A famous poet once said "Natural language is most powerful when it can draw from a rich context." Ok fine, I said that. But that's true of both poetry, and of LLMs! Well, Knowledge Graphs excel at capturing context. How can combining Knowledge Graphs with RAG – an emerging technique known as GraphRAG – give context to your RAG application, and lead to more accurate and complete results, accelerated development, and explainable AI decisions? This talk will go deep on the why and how of GraphRAG, and where best to apply it. You’ll get concepts, examples, and specifics on how you can get started. You’ll walk away with an understanding of how GraphRAG can improve the context you pass to the LLM and the performance of your AI applications.
