## Abstract

Convolutional LSTM are a class of recurrent network with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units applied over convolutional networks (CNN). They are particularly useful to for *unsupervised videos analysis*, either image segmentation, classification of annotation.
We will present how to create a convolutional LSTM model in Keras and Tensorflow for image segmentation and show some results for self-driving cars and for annotation of arteries and veins on ultra-sound videos.
