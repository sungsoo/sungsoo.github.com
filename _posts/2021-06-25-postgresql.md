# PPRGo: Scaling Graph Neural Networks with Approximate PageRank

*  Event Date: Monday June 7, 2021

*  Speaker: Robert Haas [INFO]
*  Title: PostgreSQL Optimizer Methodology

## Abstract

In this talk, Iâ€™ll talk at a high level about how the PostgreSQL query planner approaches join planning, and how it gathers and uses statistics. Without losing sight of the fact that these algorithms generally work, I want to highlight some of the annoying cases where they break down, and the problems that they can cause for users and developers.

This talk is part of the [Vaccination Database Tech Talk Seminar Series](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/seminar2021/).
