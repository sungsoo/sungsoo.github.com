## Abstract

Causal relationships are stable across distribution shifts. Models based on causal knowledge have the potential to generalize to unseen domains and offer counterfactual predictions: how do outcomes change if a certain feature is changed in the real world. In recent years, machine learning methods based on causal reasoning have led to advances in out-of-domain generalization, fairness and explanation, and robustness to data selection biases. 
In this session, we discuss big ideas at the intersections of causal inference and machine learning towards building stable predictive models and discovering causal insights from data.
