# Temporal Graph Networks for Deep Learning on Dynamic Graphs

## Abstract

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently become increasingly popular due to their ability to learn complex systems of relations or interactions arising in a broad spectrum of problems ranging from biology and particle physics to social networks and recommendation systems. Despite the plethora of different models for deep learning on graphs, few approaches have been proposed thus far for dealing with graphs that present some sort of *dynamic nature* (e.g. evolving
features or connectivity over time). In this paper, the authors present **Temporal Graph Networks** (TGNs), a generic, efficient framework for deep learning on dynamic graphs represented as sequences of timed events. Thanks to a novel combination of memory modules and graph-based operators, TGNs are able to significantly outperform previous approaches being at the same time more computationally efficient. The authors furthermore show that several previous models for learning on dynamic graphs can be cast as specific instances of the TGN framework. They perform a detailed ablation study of different components of the TGN framework and devise the best configuration that achieves state-of-the-art performance on several *transductive* and *inductive* prediction tasks for dynamic graphs.
