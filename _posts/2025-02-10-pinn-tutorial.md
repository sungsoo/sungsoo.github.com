# PINNs - Ordinary Differential Equations Tutorial

## Abstract


In this tutorial, we'll explore how to solve the 1D Poisson equation using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). You'll learn about the fundamentals of the Poisson equation, the integration of physical laws into neural networks, and how to set up, build, and train a PINN to solve this important equation. Follow along with our hands-on coding examples and gain practical insights into applying PINNs for solving differential equations. Perfect for both beginners and advanced learners, this video provides a comprehensive yet straightforward approach to mastering PINNs.
