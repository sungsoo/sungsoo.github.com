# AI & Machine Learning for Satellite Communications with SES

## Abstract

Speaking at the 2023 edition of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trustâ€™s (SnT) Partnership Day event, Dr. Flor Ortiz-Gomez discusses how artificial intelligence and machine learning are revolutionising satellite communications. In collaboration with SES, the project explores how these methods can enable a more efficient use of resources, improve data processing and analysis, as well as enhance decision making capabilities.

## From Orbit to A.I. - Harnessing Machine Learning with Landsat Data

Over the past few years, machine learning techniques have been increasingly used to analyze the vast amount of data collected by the Landsat mission, which has been circling the globe for over 50 years. The data has been used to classify different types of land cover, detect changes to landscapes over time, and map the impact of human activity on the environment. With the field constantly evolving, researchers are developing new deep learning models to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the analysis and extract even more information from the data. Here are just a few examples of how the combination of Landsat data and machine learning is providing a better understanding of our planet's past, present, and future.
