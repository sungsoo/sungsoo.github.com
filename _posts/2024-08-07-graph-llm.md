# Awesome-Graph-LLM [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A collection of AWESOME things about **Graph-Related Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in natural language processing tasks. However, their integration with graph structures, which are prevalent in real-world applications, remains relatively unexplored. This repository aims to bridge that gap by providing a curated list of research papers that explore the intersection of graph-based techniques with LLMs.
