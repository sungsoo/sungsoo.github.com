## Abstract

Ian Goodfellow is the author of the popular textbook on deep learning (simply titled "Deep Learning"). He coined the term Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and with his 2014 paper is responsible for launching the incredible growth of research on GANs. He got his BS and MS at Stanford, his PhD at University of Montreal with Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville. He held several research positions including at OpenAI, Google Brain, and now at Apple as director of machine learning. This recording happened while Ian was still at Google Brain. This conversation is part of the Artificial Intelligence podcast at MIT and beyond. Audio podcast version is available on [https://lexfridman.com/ai/](https://lexfridman.com/ai/)
