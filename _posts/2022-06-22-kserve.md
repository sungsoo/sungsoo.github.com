# KServe (Kubeflow KFServing) Live Coding Session


KFserving graduated from Kubeflow and is now Kserve. MLOps Community Meetup #83! Last Wednesday Demetrios Brinkmann and Alexey Grigorev talked to Theofilos Papapanagiotou, Data Science Architect of Prosus. 

This is the practical session following up on MLOps Meetup #40 Hands-on Serving Models Using KFserving (https://youtu.be/VtZ9LWyJPdc).

## Abstract
We start with the serialization of TensorFlow/PyTorch/SKLearn models into files and the deployment of an inference service on a Kubernetes cluster. Great MLOps means great model monitoring, so then we look at inference service metrics, model server metrics, payload logs, class distributions. 

For AI ethics on production, we use the explainers pattern with many different explainers, fairness detectors, and adversarial attacks. For integrations, we use the transformer pattern to process as well as to enrich the inference request with online features from a feature store.
