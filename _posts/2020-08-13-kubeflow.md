# Setting Up Your Kubeflow ML Environment

## Abstract

In the webinar we'll shortly introduce the different parts to Google's Kubeflow project and then set up the project so we can run something on top of it ourselves. 

Machine Learning Engineer Ruksi Laine is an experienced ML Engineer that was previously in charge of the San Francisco based startup LeapMotion's ML Infrastructure and later has built Valohai's ML Infrastructure platform. Valohai has also evaluated building it's backend on top of Kubeflow and he thus has vast experience from the scene.
