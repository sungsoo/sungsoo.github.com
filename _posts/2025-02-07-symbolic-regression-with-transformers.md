# Symbolic Regression with Transformers

## Abstract

In this video: we cover the 2022 NeurIPS paper out of Meta AI where the symbolic regression problem is solved using transformers.   The original paper can be found here: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.10532.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.10532.pdf) and the slides we used to present can be found here:
