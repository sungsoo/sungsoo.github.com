# Data Cataloging with Knowledge Graphs

## Abstract
Today, data catalogs are increasingly recognized as a central mechanism for data management. They have become a critical building block for helping organizations find, inventory, connect and analyze their diverse and distributed data assets â€” to optimize their business use and value. Knowledge graphs are a key technology for data cataloging because they can meaningfully capture and connect the vast variety of enterprise data sources. They can eliminate data and metadata silos, delivering high-value business applications such as complete end-to-end data lineage and "Google-like" semantic search over metadata.

In this webinar we discuss: 

* Why flexibility, extensibility, and open APIs are a must for data catalogs
* What enterprise data catalogs (internal to an organization) and open data catalogs in government (e.g., using the standards-based DCAT vocabulary) share in common
* The role of knowledge graphs in capturing information about diverse and siloed data assets and in creating semantic relationships between them 
* How assets in a data catalog can be contextualized by connecting them to relevant processes, policies, and other business information 
* How inferencing and machine learning can automate and simplify the process of tagging and connecting data assets
