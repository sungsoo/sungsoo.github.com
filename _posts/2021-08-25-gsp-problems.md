# Some Mathematical Problems in Graph Signal Processing

## Abstract

Graph signal processing provides an innovative framework to handle data residing on various networks and many irregular domains. It is an emerging interdisciplinary field that merges algebraic and spectral graph theory with applied and computational harmonic analysis. In this talk, I will discuss some mathematical problems related to graph signal processing, with emphasis on phase retrieval and velocity field, filtering and inverse filtering, sampling and reconstruction, and distributed verification, implementation and optimization.
