# Explainable AI - Methods, Applications & Recent Developments

Dr. Wojciech Samek discusses methods, applications and recent developments of Explainable AI, in particular, demonstrates the effectivity of explanation techniques such as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) when applied to various datatypes (images, text, audio, video, EEG/fMRI signals) and neural architectures (ConvNets, LSTMs). LRP provides information about individual predictions, e.g., heatmaps visualizing which pixels have been most relevant for the model to arrive at its decision. The talk will finish with a discussion of challenges and open questions in the field of explainable AI.
