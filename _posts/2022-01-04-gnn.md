# Performance Adaptive Sampling Strategy Towards Fast and Accurate Graph Neural Networks

## Abstract

The scalability issue of GNNs mainly comes from uncontrollable neighborhood expansion in the aggregation stage. The only way to alleviate this neighbor explosion problem is to sample a fixed number of neighbors in the aggregation operation. In this paper,  we propose a performance-adaptive sampling strategy PASS that samples neighbors informative for a target task. PASS outperforms state-of-the-art sampling methods by up to 10% accuracy on public benchmarks and up to 53% accuracy in the presence of adversarial attacks.
