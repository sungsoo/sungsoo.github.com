# Develop test suites for machine learning models and data


## Abstract

Deepchecks Open Source is a python library for data scientists and ML engineers. The package includes extensive test suites for machine learning models and data, built in a way thatâ€™s flexible, extendable and editable.

Deepchecks test suites are composed of checks. Each check contains outputs to display in a notebook and/or conditions with a pass/fail output.

- Conditions can be added or removed from a check;
- Checks can be edited or added/removed to a suite;
- Suites can be created from scratch or forked from an existing suite.

The final outcome of the test or test(s) is the report as HTML output. This Report, starts with a list of the Conditions (and which passed or not) and then continues with the Display Data (from the various checks).
