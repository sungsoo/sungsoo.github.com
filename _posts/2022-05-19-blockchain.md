# Challenges and Solutions of Using Kubernetes for Blockchain Applications

## Abstract

Kubernetes easily allowed for users to scale up and down the resources used by their application, which makes it a good fit for both proof-of-concept and product ready usage. Blockchain applications require a lot of compute power and storage and introduce their own set of unique challenges when running in a containerized environment.  In this talk, Tong will provide a brief introduction to the Blockchain and Hyperledger Fabric technologies and then dive into how they can be successfully deployed and managed on more K8S cloud providers (e.g. IKS, GKE and AKS). Highlighting the challenges Blockchain poses for networking, storage and CPU resources, he will then discuss the solutions he developed for each and how you can leverage them yourselves - finally, touching on what possible features might be needed in the future to make K8S even more robust for these compute intensive applications.
