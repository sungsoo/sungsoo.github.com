# A Database Tuning Tool that "Reads the Manual"

## Abstract

DB-BERT is an automated tuning tool for database systems. It mines tuning hints from text documents and uses them as a starting point for iterative tuning. During iterative tuning, it uses reinforcement learning to decide how to adapt, prioritize, and aggregate hints from different sources.
