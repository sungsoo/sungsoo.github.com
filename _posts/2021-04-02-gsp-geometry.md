## Abstract

Data is now multimodal and unstructured, arising in many applications and formats. *Graph Signal Processing* (GSP), an expression coined in the last few years, structires the data by representing its underlying geometry with a graph. The nodes of the graph index the data, while its edges capture data dependencies. We present the basics of GSP with a brief historical overview, illustrate some of its concepts, recent developments, and extensions.
