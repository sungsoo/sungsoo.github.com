# How I Understand Flow Matching


## Abstract

Flow matching is a new generative modeling method that combines the advantages of Continuous Normalising Flows (CNFs) and Diffusion Models (DMs).

In this tutorial, I share my understanding of the basics of flow matching and provide an overview of how these ideas evolve over time.
