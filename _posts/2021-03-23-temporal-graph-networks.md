## TGN: Key Insights

* **Memory**: to store the dynamic state of each node. It's updated each time a node is involved in an interaction.
* **Graph Embedding**: when computing the temporal embedding for a node, aggregate the memories of the neighbors.


## TGN: Modules and Training

**Computations performed by TGN on a batch of time-stamped interactions.**

**Flow of operations of TGN used to train the memory-related modules.**


## Conclusion

- **Dynamic graphs** are very common, but have *received little attention so far.*
- We propose **TGN**, which *generalizes existing models* and achieves **SOTA results** on a variety of benchmarks.
- The ablation study shows the **importance of the different modules**.
