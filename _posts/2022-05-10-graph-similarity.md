## Abstract

In many domains where data are represented as graphs, learning a similarity metric among graphs is considered a key problem, which can further facilitate various learning tasks, such as classification, clustering, and similarity search. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in deep graph similarity learning, where the key idea is to learn a deep learning model that maps input graphs to a target space such that the distance in the target space approximates the structural distance in the input space. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature of deep graph similarity learning. We propose a systematic taxonomy for the methods and applications. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions for this problem.
