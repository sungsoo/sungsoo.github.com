## Abstract

The goal of this talk is to introduce the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method -- a *physics-inspired* algorithm for sampling from Gibbs densities. We focus on the *idealized* case, where one can compute continuous trajectories exactly. We show that idealized HMC preserves the target density and we establish its convergence when *f* is strongly convex.
