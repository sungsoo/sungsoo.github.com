## DeepSeek facts vs hype, model distillation, and open source competition

Letâ€™s bust some early myths about DeepSeek. In episode 40 of Mixture of Experts, join host Tim Hwang along with experts Aaron Baughman, Chris Hay and Kate Soule. Last week, we covered the release of DeepSeek-R1; now that the entire world is up to speed, letâ€™s separate the facts from the hype. Next, what is model distillation and why does it matter for competition in AI? Finally, Sam Altman among other tech CEOs shared his response to DeepSeek. Will R1 radically change the open-source strategy of other tech giants? Find out all this and more on Mixture of Experts.

## The Engineering Unlocks Behind DeepSeek

Chinese AI company DeepSeek recently made waves when it announced R1, an open-source reasoning model that it claimed achieved comparable performance to OpenAIâ€™s o1, at a fraction of the cost. But for those following AI developments closely, DeepSeek and R1 didnâ€™t come out of nowhere.

In this episode of YC Decoded, General Partner Diana Hu breaks down the key engineering optimizations behind DeepSeek's remarkable new models â€” and contextualizes them within the broader history of recent AI breakthroughs.

# DeepSeek R1 Theory Overview


## Abstract

Here's an overview of the DeepSeek R1 paper. I read the paper this week and I was fascinated by the methods, however it was a bit difficult to follow what was going on with all the models being used.

I found a neat map of the methodology which I'll be using in this tutorial to walk you through the paper.

I strongly recommend you to still read the paper over here:
