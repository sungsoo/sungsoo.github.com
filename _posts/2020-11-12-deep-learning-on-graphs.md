# Deep Learning on Graphs: Successes, Challenges, and Next Steps

 
## Abstract

Deep learning on graphs and *network-structured data* has recently become one of the hottest topics in machine learning. Graphs are powerful mathematical abstractions that can describe complex systems of relations and interactions in fields ranging from biology and high-energy physics to social science and economics. In this talk, I will outline the basic methods, applications, challenges and possible future directions in the field.
