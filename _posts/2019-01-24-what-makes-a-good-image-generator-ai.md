## What Makes a Good Image Generator AI?

Three paper recommendations this time: 

- Inception score - ["Improved Techniques for Training GANs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498)
- ["Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196)
- [Inception score criticism - "A Note on the Inception Score"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01973)
