# Graph-Based Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) and HNSW


## Abstract

In the last decade graph-based indexes have gained massive popularity due to their effectiveness, generality and dynamic nature and are now the backbone of many practical large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search solutions. In this practical workshop led by Yury Malkov, author of HNSW, and James Briggs, Staff Developer Advocate at Pinecone, youâ€™ll get an overview of the graph algorithms for nearest neighbor search, and, in particular, HNSW, so you can apply them to your applications.
