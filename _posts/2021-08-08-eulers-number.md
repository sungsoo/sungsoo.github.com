# What is Euler's Number 'e'?

## Abstract

In this lesson, you will learn what Euler's number is and why it is important in math.  We will learn that Euler's number comes from the exponential growth of money when the compounding period is allowed to get very, very small.  Euler's number is then used to form the natural exponential function e^x and its inverse, the natural logarithm ln(x).  The exponential function is special because it is the only function whose rate of change is equal to the value of the function itself and whose area under the curve is also equal to the value of the function itself.
