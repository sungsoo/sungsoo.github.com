## Abstract

Richard Socher, CEO & Founder of You.com, reveals the secret to achieving broader AI adoption in the enterprise. While building a quick AI prototype with a large language model is easy, scaling these prototypes to be accurate and reliable is the real challenge. In this session, Richard dives into the crucial steps for turning AI proofs-of-concept into dependable, business-critical systems. He also discusses how to ground large language models (LLMs) in factual knowledge, enhance their reasoning abilities, and implement robust fact-checking. Discover how to build an AI Operating System that prioritizes accuracy and reliability.
