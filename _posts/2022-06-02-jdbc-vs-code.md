# Java to MySQL using Visual Studio Code

## Abstract

We use Visual Studio Code to write Java to connect to a MySQL database running locally on your computer. The video covers getting the JAR file, checking the SQL, building the Java code to connect, and a good set of try/catch statements.

This video was recorded for my database students at Pittsburgh Technical College.
