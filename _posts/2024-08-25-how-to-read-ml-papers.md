# How to Read Machine Learning Research Papers

## Abstract

New breakthroughs in artificial intelligence are constantly coming out, from language models like GPT-3 to image generation models like Dall-E. However, the details of how these models work are often presented as academic papers, which can be dense and difficult to de-obfuscate. In this talk, we will discuss simple strategies for reading academic machine learning papers and dissect several deep learning papers as examples. We will cover how to cut through complicated domain-specific lingo and how to extract important ideas present in the text. We will also have a time for you to ask questions! We hope that this talk will provide you with a primer on how to meaningfully engage academic ML research.
