## Abstract

In our short paper, we outline the idea of applying the concept of a learned index structure to approximate nearest neighbor query processing.
We discuss different data partitioning approaches and show how the task of identifying the disc pages of potential hits for a given query can be solved by a predictive machine learning model.
