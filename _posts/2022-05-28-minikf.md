# MiniKF: Kubeflow on your laptop


## Abstract

In this webinar we will introduce you to MiniKF, the fastest and easiest way to get started with Kubeflow. We will install MiniKF from scratch on a laptop, and show you around the various Kubeflow components and Rok, Arrikto's data management product.

The latest MinKF delivers a simplified model building experience for data scientists and dramatically improves the workflow to create and run Kubeflow Pipelines. It comes with all the features of Kubeflow v0.5, plus the ability to run end-to-end Kubeflow Pipelines locally starting from your Notebook.
