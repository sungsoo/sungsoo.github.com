# Quantum Computing in Practice



## Abstract

Welcome to Quantum Computing in Practice! The aim of this course is to teach a broad audience (yes, that includes you!) how to use quantum processors of over 100 qubits.

In this course we will discuss application areas of importance, error mitigation strategies, and best practices for Qiskit Runtime. In order to be prepared for this full course, we recommend already being familiar with the basics of quantum computing. You can check out John Watrous' course on Understanding Quantum Information and Computation to quickly get up to speed!

Scaling up circuits and experiments to the Utility scale can be tricky at first, so join us by subscribing to the channel to get notified when the newest episodes drops.
