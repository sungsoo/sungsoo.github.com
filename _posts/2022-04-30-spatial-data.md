## Abstract
Spatial Data, also referred to as geospatial data, is the information that identifies the geographic location of physical objects on Earth. Itâ€™s data that can be mapped, as it is stored as coordinates and topology. In this video, we introduce the concept of Spatial Data and break down the fundamentals of interacting with Spatial Data using common development tools. We then explore how these basics can be expanded upon in modern applications to assist in daily tasks, perform detailed analyses, or create interactive user experiences.
