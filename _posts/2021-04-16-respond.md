How to respond to reviewers' comments: A practical guide for authors 
====

In February 2020, [*Nature*
announced](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00309-9) that it
would give authors the option to publish their referee reports and
responses to reviewers. Though this change is only a trial for this
journal, other *Nature Research* journals have opened the peer-review
process. I applaud the effort of these and other journals to make peer
review more transparent, and hope it will become a standard.

Whether you publish your referee reports with your paper or not, how you
respond to reviewers’ comments on submitted articles is essential to
publication.

This guide can help you prepare well-crafted **letters to
reviewers**.

The right mindset drives the right response
-------------------------------------------

Before you respond to reviewers’ comments, celebrate that your [research
paper](http://www.languageediting.com/research-paper-outline-template/)
was sent to peer review. And be grateful that the reviewers carved time
out of their schedules to evaluate your work for free.

Getting a harsh reviewer is possible, but it doesn’t happen often. Most
reviewers are helpful and offer constructive criticism, but they don’t
waste much ink praising the manuscript.

While a helpful review summarizes the major positives and details the
negatives of a manuscript, in general, most reviewer comments are
negative. Or, you’ll perceive them as negative. This doesn’t mean your
paper has more weaknesses than strengths. It means that the reviewer has
to detail your paper’s limitations, as these—not its strong points—need
to be addressed by your revision.

Revise the manuscript before you respond to reviewers
-----------------------------------------------------

When you’re ready to deal with the reviewers’ comments in a
professional, objective manner, discuss the peer review reports with
your co-authors.

Decide which changes to accept and which to rebut, revise the paper, and
only then start writing your responses to reviewers.

Responding to reviewers’ comments
---------------------------------

-   Begin by **thanking the reviewer** for taking the time to assess
    your manuscript.
-   Then, specify that you’ve **addressed** all the concerns
    they raised. Addressing a reviewer’s comment doesn’t mean you made
    the change the reviewer suggested. It means that you’ve considered
    it and either made the change or explained why you chose not to.
-   List all the **reviewer’s comments and your answer** to each one.
    Use a different font or color to highlight your responses. This
    makes the text easier to scan.
-   Avoid giving **yes or no answers**. Even if you’ve been asked to
    make minor changes, such as correcting a misspelled word, say “We’ve
    corrected the typo.” If it’s a more serious mistake, you may also
    add “We apologize for our error.”
-   Whenever possible, make your responses to reviewers
    **self-contained**. The reviewer or editor shouldn’t have to peruse
    the manuscript to find a change you made. So, instead of “We’ve made
    the change. See page 5, line 24 of the revised paper”, write “We’ve
    changed \[original text\] to \[edited text\] (page 5, line 24)”. But
    if you rewrote an entire paragraph or section, respond, “We have
    revised the text to address your concerns and hope that it is
    now clearer. Please see page 5 of the revised manuscript, lines
    9–20, and page 6, lines 1–20.”
-   Do not omit any concern raised by a reviewer. You should **address
    each and every comment**—either make the change or reject it and
    justify your choice.
-   **Pick your battles wisely:** Even if you don’t agree with a **minor
    change** suggested by a reviewer, it’s usually easiest to just make
    the change. It shows you’re open to suggestions.
-   Be **tactful** when explaining why you disagree with the reviewer.
    To support your argument, you may use [supplementary
    material](https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/journal-author/revising-your-paper-and-responding-to-reviewer-comments/1422),
    such as figures and tables, that you won’t include in
    the manuscript.
-   When a [reviewer fails to
    understand](https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article/57/4/551/5621037)
    a point you made, don’t assume they’re ignorant. If they failed to
    understand something you wrote, you’ve failed to express your idea
    clearly, and you confused at least one reader. So, it’s likely the
    text needs
    **[editing](http://www.languageediting.com/should-i-edit-my-own-research-paper/)
    for clarity and logic**. (Related post: *[What to do if the journal
    editor recommends English language editing
    services](http://www.languageediting.com/what-to-do-if-the-journal-editor-recommends-english-language-editing-services/)*).
-   Respond to each referee as if they were the **only reviewer** of
    your paper. Do not respond to one reviewer with “Please see our
    answer to comment 34 of Reviewer \#2”.
-   End the letter to the reviewer with a sentence such as, “We would
    like to **thank the referee again** for taking the time to review
    our manuscript.”

How to reply to peer review comments when submitting papers for publication
---------

The length of a response depends on the complexity of the question. I’ve
edited two-page letters to reviewers, and I’ve edited 30-page letters. A
letter to a reviewer should be as long as it needs to be to allow you to
prove you’ve considered the criticism you received.

### When you agree with a reviewer

This is the simplest case. Acknowledge your mistake and confirm you’ve
corrected it.

Examples:

-   We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have revised
-   We have removed
-   We agree and have updated
-   We have fixed the error
-   This observation is correct. We have changed
-   We have made the change. The new sentence reads as follows

### When you disagree with a reviewer’s comment

Choose your words carefully when drafting your response. First,
emphasize any part of the reviewer’s comment you agree with. Then
explain why you chose not to make the change.

Examples:

-   We agree with the reviewer that further elaborating on this point
    using new data would be helpful. However, we believe that expanding
    our dataset is neither feasible, given the costs involved, nor would
    significantly support our argument. For this reason, we chose not to
    make this change, but we added the following sentence to paragraph 3
    in the discussion: “Though having a larger dataset would offer
    further insight…”.
-   We apologize if our original Figure 2 did not show…. We did not
    intend to…. We have modified the figure and hope that it is now
    clear that…. We believe that adding a new figure, as the reviewer
    suggested, would be unnecessary given that our new Figure 2 shows….
-   We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful suggestion and agree that it
    would be useful to demonstrate that…; however, such an analysis is
    beyond the scope of our paper, which aims only to show that….
    Nevertheless, we recognize this limitation should be mentioned in
    the paper, so we added the following sentence….

In sum, whether you agree or disagree with the reviewer, aim to prove
that you understood their comments and took them seriously.

### What to do when reviewers disagree

When reviewers give you **conflicting suggestions**, don’t respond, “As
another reviewer suggested the opposite, we didn’t change the text”.
Make a decision. Pick the suggestion you agree with and justify your
choice to the other reviewer.

For example, you may say [something like
this](http://www.ilr.uni-bonn.de/agpo/courses/pw/Cummings_et_al_reviewers%20comments.pdf),
“As we received conflicting advice from another reviewer, we decided to
make the change they suggested, because…. We hope this was the right
decision.”

### How to respond to reviewer comments—journal examples

Here are some examples of **letters to reviewers**. Note that the
authors who rejected a reviewer’s suggestion provided a valid
justification:

-   <https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~haoz/pubs/zhang_cgf09_review_response.pdf>
-   <https://www.bmj.com/sites/default/files/attachments/bmj-article/pre-pub-history/Second_response_18.5.15.pdf>
-   <https://perso.citi.insa-lyon.fr/rstanica/reviews/answers1.pdf>
-   <https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-020-14449-z/MediaObjects/41467_2020_14449_MOESM1_ESM.pdf>
-   <https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-020-14661-x/MediaObjects/41467_2020_14661_MOESM2_ESM.pdf>

To find other examples, check the journals that publish the
correspondence between authors, reviewers, and journal editors.

Responding to reviewers: Advice from the perspective of a language editor
-------

When you respond to reviewers’ comments, maintain a **positive
attitude** and **be open to criticism**. Your responses will tend to
reflect your attitude at the time of writing. Word choice, tone,
syntax—they may all reveal to the reader your true colors.

I’ve edited letters to reviewers that conveyed the message that their
authors did not welcome criticism to their manuscripts. Their tone was
overly formal, the sentences too short, and the examples few. These
letters needed [editing](http://www.languageediting.com/editing/) for
style to make them sound more like a discussion between professionals
than a court defense.

And I’ve edited other letters that showed the author genuinely
appreciated the reviewers’ comments. The authors of these letters used a
positive tone, and their language was less formal and more
conversational.

In my experience, the letters in the first category tend to be much
shorter than those in the second, and maybe it’s not just a coincidence.

Responding to reviewers can seem like a chore, as nobody likes their
work to be criticized. But if you see the reviewers’ comments as an
**opportunity to improve your research paper** and get credit for it,
responding to reviews will feel less burdensome.
