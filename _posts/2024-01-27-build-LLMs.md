# How to Build LLMs on Your Company’s Data While on a Budget 


## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) are taking AI mainstream across companies and individuals. However, public LLMs are trained on general-purpose data. They do not include your own corporate data and they are black boxes on how they are trained. Because terminology is different for healthcare, financial, retail, digital-native and other industries, companies today are looking for industry-specific LLMs to better understand the terminology, context and knowledge that better suits their needs. In contrast to closed LLMs, open source-based models can be used for commercial usage or customized to suit an enterprise’s needs on their own data. Learn how Databricks makes it easy for you to build, tune and use custom models, including a deep dive into Dolly, the first open source, instruction-following LLM, fine-tuned on a human-generated instruction dataset licensed for research and commercial use.

In this session, you will:

- See a real-life demo of creating your own LLMs specific to your industry
- Learn how to securely train on your own documents if needed
- Learn how Databricks makes it quick, scalable and inexpensive
- Deep dive into Dolly and its applications
