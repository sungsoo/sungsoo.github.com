# Interpretable Deep Learning for New Physics Discovery


## Abstract

In this video, Miles Cranmer discusses a method for converting a neural network into an analytic equation using a particular set of inductive biases. The technique relies on a sparsification of latent spaces in a deep neural network, followed by symbolic regression. In their paper, they demonstrate that they can recover physical laws for various simple and complex systems. For example, they discover gravity along with planetary masses from data; they learn a technique for doing cosmology with cosmic voids and dark matter halos; and they show how to extract the Euler equation from a graph neural network trained on turbulence data.
