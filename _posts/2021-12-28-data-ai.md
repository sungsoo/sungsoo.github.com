# Apache Spark, Data Science + Machine Learning


## Abstract

The pursuit of AI is one of the biggest priorities in data today. The Thursday morning keynote will be led by Databricks Co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi and cover advances in data science, machine learning, MLOps and more in both open source and the Databricks Lakehouse Platform. Stay tuned for some exciting announcements.

We'll also be joined by a co-creator of TensorFlow, data leaders from McDonald's, as well as the legendary Bill Nye, a scientist, engineer, comedian, and author.
