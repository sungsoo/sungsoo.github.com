# Categories for AI 1; Why Category Theory?

Motivated by the recent emergence of category theory in machine learning, we teach a course on its philosophy, applications and outlook from the perspective of machine learning!

* Sign up for the course at: [https://cats.for.ai/](https://cats.for.ai/)

In this first seminar, you will:

- Get a sense of the philosophy and motivation behind Category Theory
- Learn about the recent wave of its applications emerging throughout the sciences
- Understand how this formal mathematical language rigorously adheres to the concept of modularity
- Dispel with the fallacy that CT is not relevant to practical disciplines such as programming or engineering
- Get a sense of how CT can help us design and scale our deep learning systems
