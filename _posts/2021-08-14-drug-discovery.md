# Drug Discovery with GANs

## Abstract

How do we use AI to cure drug discovery? This is apart of my AI for business series right here on Youtube. Subscribe to stay up to date! In this video I'm going to cover how the drug discovery process works in clinical labs and how AI can be used to speed up that process by orders of magnitude. We'll look at 3 different papers that used different types of neural networks, and the last one is what we'll focus on; the General Adversarial Network.
