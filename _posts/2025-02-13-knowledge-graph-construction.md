# Step-by-step Code for Knowledge Graph Construction

## Abstract


In this episode, join Angelina and Mehdi,  for a code walk through for constructing a basic Knowledge Graph for your RAG system. We contrast the traditional approach for building KG vs. the new approach using the large language models to extract entities and relationship in your data. We also explain why we chose the hybrid approach for constructing this example KG. We will create a simple KG for one of our favorite actors: Tom Hanks!
