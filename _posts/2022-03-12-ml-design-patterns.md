## Abstract

Design patterns capture best practices and solutions to recurring problems. Join us for the great talks and AMA, by the authors of the newly released O’Reilly book “Machine Learning Design Patterns”, covering solutions to common challenges in Data Preparation, Model Building, and MLOps. Lak, Sara and Michael will introduce three of these tried-and-proven methods to help engineers tackle problems that frequently crop up during the ML process. And we will wrap up the event with AMA (Ask Me Anything).

Congratulations to the top 5 winners of the Kahoot quiz: Steve, Csaba, Subarno, Chris and Manoj! Each of you will receive a free copy of the book.
