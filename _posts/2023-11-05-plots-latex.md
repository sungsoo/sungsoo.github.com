# How I make beautiful GRAPHS and PLOTS using LaTeX



## Abstract

I make most of my graph and plots inside of LaTeX using a package called pgfplots. LaTeX is a type setting language and I like using it for graphs specifically because I can control all aspects of my graphs very precisely, with formatting native and easily adjustable with the rest of my document, with syntax similar to the syntax of the rest of LaTeX that I use all the time, and best of all it is free and will remain readily available.  In this video we will see how to do 2D graphs, scatter plots, bar charts, 3D surface plots and 3D line plots, as well as how to format all aspects of our plots and axes.
