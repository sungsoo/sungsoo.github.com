# Random Walks on Directed Graphs

## Abstract

Random walks on undirected graphs have been extensively studied in the literature. In contrast, while numerous real-world complex networks and related applications concern *directed graphs*, the theory for random walks on directed graphs and the associated *spectral approaches*  have not been as well developed. In this talk, we will discuss various problems and  results on **random walks on directed graphs**, as well as some methods and  applications arising in dealing with directed complex networks.
