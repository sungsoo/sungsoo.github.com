In this article we will learn how to use network datasets for extracting
information and resources from where we can get them. Which libraries
can be used to analyze them. Also later on, we will try to understand
*connectedness* property in graphs and implications of it. Main aim of
this article is to lay foundation of concepts of network datasets and
show some interesting properties related to it..

Getting Started With Network Datasets 
=====================================

Real World Networks developed with human related data often
exhibit social properties i.e. patterns in graph from which **human
behavioral patterns** can be analyzed and mined for valuable
information. The Power of which is being used by all the companies to
maximize their throughput. Well to start with, all of us use different
social media networks either to find jobs, express our views, make
friends, stay connected, gaming, dating and many more things. Also, the
domain is not restricted to these social sites instead business
decisions for marketing & sales, supply-chain management and
advertisements gets influenced by knowledge of analyzing networks.

Network of Enterprises in a functioning Supply-Chain mechanism.

Now, these networks are not random networks where a node gets added
randomly, they exhibit special properties. What special properties to
consider? Let's take one property for example connectedness. By
connectedness we mean that there is no isolated vertices in the existing
graph.

## Connectedness

Are these large scale real world social graphs **connected** ? **Yes**,
if not definitely the probability of them being not connected is very
less. Consider a case, in a class there are 50 students each making only
three friends (quite an unsocial class ðŸ˜‰). What is the probability of
this being disconnected at a given instance?

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/538/1*ZSamBf_lUSIDs2Z9taWvfQ.png)

Solution: For simplicity, letâ€™s say class gets divided into two groups of m & n. P(E) = 1/(m*n). This highly improbable event in deed with P(E(m=25,n=25)) = 0.0016.

This was the case for small class imagine it for very large scale
networks where 'm' & 'n' goes to very large values, event of graph being
disconnected is highly improbable for real life networks. This
connectedness property can be analyzed with following stated problem
statement.

> **Given 'n' nodes, what is the minimum number of edges that needed to
> be added in a completely disconnected graph, So that, graph becomes
> connected in nature?** It can also be stated as **when will a graph
> have no isolated vertex, provided edges are inserted uniformly at
> random?**

If we solve this problem using probabilistic analysis, the results will
be as follows : if we put **n\*log(n)** edges than probability of this
graph being disconnected is (1/n)Â². Since, this n being very large on
real world networks, it is an improbable event to occur. Well, what are
implication of such a property ? Take one such case where all facebook
friends are connected each containing their respective information.

## Implications 

Consider the case of Cambridge Analytica (excluding political
conversation). Since, based on our assumption that the network of
friends in US is connected on facebook, with a loophole in Facebook API
they were able to access raw data of 87 million people by analyzing data
about friends of facebook users who took the quiz. Just to talk about
the scale of impact here 270,000 users took the quiz using which they
were able to access **322 times** more data from that. Property of
accessing information about friends of friends and chain goes on. Also,
which is **27% of entire population** of USA, just from **a simple
quiz**. That data then being used for malicious reasons to influence
democracy. Imagine data handled by big tech Giants and the power that
they hold now from analytics of data from these social networks. So,
let's get a glimpse onto this topic and its analysis.

In what shape or form this data exists? This thing is quite intuitive
that it will store information about graphs with many nodes and edges.
Also, each of which will exhibit some special properties that can be
stored as attributes and weights. Now, let's take a look at different
forms this data is represented.

## Datasets 

Let's see different format of datasets that are available to us for
analyzing.

1.  [**CSV Format:** Data being presented in either Edgelist format or
    Adjacency List format. Edge List format contains two/three values in
    each line **(To, From, \[Weight\])** node giving an idea about edges
    that exist in graph with any weight if attached. In Adjacency List
    first value in a row is source node and succeeding nodes are the
    ones to which edge is present. For example: **\[Source, Node1,
    Node2, ...\]**.]
2.  [**GML Format:** One of the most common formats as provide huge
    flexibility for graphs to store information. It is modeling language
    to store information about node, edges, labels, attributes
    etc.]

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/188/1*E5Uec25m-qYGOhF0h41u2A.png)

GML Example with graph attribute, node attribute and edge labels.

3. **Pajek Net Format**: Uses .NET extensions. There are two columns
present in this format one vertices which specifies label of nodes
another specifies edges between nodes. If nodes don't have any labels
then row entries below vertices column can be skipped. Also, an
attribute value can be added if needed.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/273/1*2xIEFyazGjWCgHhVHcA7Pg.png)

Below vertices column attribute labels and below arcs column edges between nodes are specified.

4. **GraphML Format:** Uses xml tag structures to store information
about a graph ends with .graphml extension. Here, graphml tag store
metadata about the graph, graph tag for attributes about graph. Node
tag, which specifies all the properties about nodes and than edge tags
are there to give edge specifications. Also, an optional key tag can be
used to assign weight to edges and attributes to nodes.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/627/1*EMUiQUerYoJmGfmwxXzePA.png)
Graph XML format with key tag to provide descriptions about nodes and edges

5. **GEXF Format:** Graph Exchange XML Format, developed by Gephi
organization. Much similar to graphXML format. It is a language for
describing complex networks structures, their associated data and
dynamics. Gelphi tool is also used for easy visualization of network
graphs.

GEXF format, with meta-data, nodes and edges attributes and descriptors.

We can download these datasets from repositories like
[SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/),
[Konect](http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/),
[UCI](https://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/resources.php) etc. Also,
you can search them Google's dataset search. For analyzing these
datasets using popular python libraries
[*networkx*](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/tutorial.html) and visualizing
[*MatplotLib*](https://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html) is a very good option*.* Click on specified links for basic
tutorials to get started with, otherwise you can also follow along with
coding examples in this article. Here, is an example to get started
with.

``` 
# Draws circular plot of the network
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import networkx as nx

G = nx.karate_club_graph() # data can be read from specified stored social graph in networkx library.
print("Node Degree")
for v in G:
    print (v, G.degree(v))
nx.draw_circular(G, with_labels=True) # different plot layouts possible
plt.show()
```

## Minor NetworkX Demo 

Consider case of a popular karate club known as Zachary karate club
where two teachers had a conflict and tried recruiting members in each
others group. It is clear that there will be two groups formed at the
end. Can we predict what those groups are? Which person is on whose
side, by properties of graph?

Now, inter-community edges have high **betweenness i.e. number of
shortest path between any two nodes are high.** An intuition for this is
let's consider two cities connected by a bridge, in order to connect any
two points b/w two cities we must pass from that bridge. Resulting in
that bridge being used always to connect two communities like in above
case of two groups getting formed after fight.

These edges keeping the graph connected and acting as bridges. What we
can do is remove these edges upto a safe limit and observe the
communities that exist, if the graph becomes disconnected at that point.
Like, if we remove that bridge b/w towns they will be disconnected.
Similarly here, consider two groups in Zachary karate clubs are
connected by few bridges which might be result of earlier friendship
existing b/w those two people.

``` 
import networkx as nx  # Python 2.x, NetworkX 2.0import networkx as nxdef edge_to_remove(G):  # high betweenness edges are removed first
 dic1 = nx.edge_betweenness_centrality(G)
 list_tuples = dic1.items()
 list_tuples.sort(key =lambda x:x[1], reverse = True)
 return list_tuples[0][0] #(a,b)def girvan(G): # returns number of connected components
 c = nx.connected_component_subgraphs(G)
 i=0
 while(i<11): # you can experiment with different values
  G.remove_edge(*edge_to_remove(G)) 
 return cG = nx.karate_club_graph() # imports popular zachary karate club
c = girvan(G) # After enough edge removal, groups printedfor i in c:
 print 'Group Nodes: ', i.nodes()
 print 'Number Of Nodes: ', i.number_of_nodes()Output :Group Nodes:  [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 21]
Number Of Nodes:  15
Group Nodes:  [32, 33, 2, 8, 9, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]
Number Of Nodes:  19
```

Let's analyze the **connectedness property in more detail** and see what
interesting information can be derived from it when social constructs
are applied on it. What more can we leverage? Take this case of Daman,
who is from Delhi and wants to connect to Lana from L.A. in 1970 with
post or mailing service but only with the help of friends or friends of
friends. Now, it might be reasonable to assume all the communities at
that time were connected, is the friendship graph of world connected?
Based on our argument above it is reasonable to assume world is
connected. In order to deliver a message how many hops is required on an
average i.e. how many intermediate people are required on an average to
deliver his letter?

## Six degrees of separation 

Only six hops on an average is required for such a message transfer.
Meaning only six people on an average can deliver his message, such
small number of friends required to deliver a far out message is
incredible. But, why such less hops ?

The answer is **homophily(***similar nodes connect and form communities
with high clustering co-efficient***)** and **weak ties(***generally
bridges between two such cluster***)**. Meaning the people in
neighborhood are very well connected but at the same time they have
connections to far out node which are less probable but still feasible.
Like one of your friend can know someone in California, other one knows
people in Europe and so on.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*H2y4moBlaVQ6diDm.jpg)
From above structure homophily and weak ties are visible. Observe nearby nodes being very well connected and some far fetched links in network.

Both these are discussed in above example of Zachary club with two
communities resulted because of homophily two similar nodes getting
connected and high betweenness edges as weak ties as some friends might
be there even in opposite groups.

In real world networks, it can be understood with a stochastic
explanation like there is less probability forming long ties as compared
to a smaller one. Reason can be geographic like in above case resulting
in less neighborhood overlap i.e. with more distance less probable links
of friendship are extended.

Probability decays **d**th power of dimensionality of space

How to detect it in a network dataset? Analyze only the average shortest
path length which will be closer to 6 or will be drastically small
compared to network size. That would mean that graph/network exhibit
**small world phenomenon**.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/138/0*KKjppmdpZ2Lym2Yx.png)

Where **V** is set of nodes in **G. d(s,t)** is the shortest path from *s* to *t*, *n* is number of nodes in *G*.

First read any desired graph in any format you are comfortable in, [refer documentation](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/readwrite.html). Then use the following function in code snippet.

``` 
# Networkx Examples
G =nx.karate_club_graph() # Can be applied on different graphs
print(nx.average_shortest_path_length(G))
G = nx.florentine_families_graph()
print(nx.average_shortest_path_length(G))
G = nx.davis_southern_women_graph()
print(nx.average_shortest_path_length(G))
```

After this let's apply it onto some real dataset lets say
[facebook_combined](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/facebook_combined.txt.gz) dataset from
[SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.html)
containing data in edgelist format from all ego-nets. And try to
simulate Cambridge-analytica's case study, how users were connected to
each other, will also recommend to visualize this with matplotlib.

``` 
G = nx.read_edgelist('Desktop/facebook_combined.txt')
print(nx.average_shortest_path_length(G)) # Takes 4 mins approx.
[Output]: 3.6925068497 # Confirms our statement above.
```

Above code almost replicate study done by [**facebook research.**](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*tVZHCjKpSuSGY2Y3.png?q=20)

This reduced distance from 6 can be attributed to the fact it much
easier to connect due to globalization that has happened with world
being more connected than ever as compared to when
[Milgram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_experiment)
conducted his experiment.

Now, what's the interpretation of this result? A very large scale graph
with very less average shortest path property. It would mean that we can
search relation between any two nodes in **O(k) constant time**. This is
also known as decentralized search. Or myopic search as we can see only
upto a certain extent from our connections. This will allow us extract
information b/w any two nodes at any distance with a constant time
lookup.

Imagine the implications of such phenomenon, this will result in very
fast rapid exchange of information b/w the nodes independent of
vicinity. This can clearly be seen with Vines, Memes getting viral
throughout the internet and probably as a result of this phenomenon
'Break the Internet' term was coined.

## Conclusion

Analyzing properties of real world large networks specific to a domain
gives advantages in data mining capabilities when we are aware of such
special properties that these graphs will exhibit. Like connectedness
there are many more important properties to explore like Power Law,
Cascading Effect, Link Prediction, Pseudo cores, Spatial and Community
arrangements, Evolutionary networks each one deserving separate
discussion. Knowledge of these does help in reducing the effort working
with these large network datasets. Few important ones I'll definitely
discuss in upcoming articles on more real use-cases. Also, will
definitely encourage you to read books like *Mining The Social Web* &
*Network, Crowd and Markets Reasoning about a Highly Connected World*.
