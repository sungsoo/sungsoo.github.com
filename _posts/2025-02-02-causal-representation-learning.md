# Causal Representation Learning in the Context of Perturbation Screens

## Abstract


Caroline Uhler is a Professor at MIT with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Institute for Data, Systems and Society, and Co-Director of the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Her research focuses on machine learning, statistics and computational biology, in particular on causal inference, generative modeling and applications to genomics, for example on linking the spatial organization of the DNA with gene regulation. This video is titled "Causal Representation Learning in the Context of Perturbation Screens" and is from the NSF-NIH Workshop on Foundational AI Techniques in Biology held on June 8-9, 2023.
