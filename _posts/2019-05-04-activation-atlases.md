# Exploring And Attacking Neural Networks With Activation Atlases

* Paper: [Exploring And Attacking Neural Networks With Activation Atlases](https://distill.pub/2019/activation-atlas/)

## Abstract

By using *feature inversion* to visualize millions of activations from an image classification network, we create an explorable *activation atlas* of features the network has learned which can reveal how the network typically represents some concepts.
