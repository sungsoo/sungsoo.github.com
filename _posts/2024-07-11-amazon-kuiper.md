# Project Kuiper: Fast, Affordable Broadband for Unserved & Underserved Communities

## Abstract

Amazonâ€™s Project Kuiper is an initiative to increase global broadband access through a constellation of satellites in low Earth orbit. In this video, residents and small business owners in Cle Elum, Washington share how their community is affected by limited broadband access, and Project Kuiper team members share more about their mission is to deliver fast, affordable broadband to unserved and underserved communities around the world.

## Project Kuiper: Amazon's satellite internet to compete with Starlink

Amazon's Project Kuiper will provide internet service via 3,236 satellites, competing with SpaceX Starlink and others.  The October 6 test launch was declared a success, so deployment will start in 2024. The system is compared to Starlink, considering issues such as the apparent lack of intersatellite links at least in the initial phases. Also, Amazon finally contracted for 3 Falcon 9 launches. If more are purchased, that could help it meet its difficult goals of launching enough satellites to keep its license.  At a minimum, the 3 launches should relieve pressure from a shareholder lawsuit and potential challenges if a deadline extension is needed. Now, every active Starlink competitor does or will use SpaceX launches!

NOTE:  since this video was published Dec. 9, Amazon announced on Dec. 14, that it secretly had been testing laser-based intersatellite links for Project Kuiper, and that the project will use them.   As explained in the video, this will make Kuiper a more formidable competitor to Starlink once enough satellites are in place.

This video is also a segment in the December 9, 2023 Monthly Space News.
