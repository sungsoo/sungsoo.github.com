# LLMs for Causal Inference


## Abstract

Emre Kiciman, Senior Principal Researcher at Microsoft, talks about pywhy-llm, a new experimental library that focuses on using large language models for causality.

PyWhy-LLM is an innovative library designed to augment human expertise by seamlessly integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into the causal analysis process. It empowers users with access to knowledge previously only available through domain experts. As part of the PyWhy community, we aim to investigate and harness the capabilities of LLMs for enhancing causal analysis process.

**PyWhy Causality in Practice**: A talk series focusing on causality and machine learning, especially from a practical perspective. We'll have tutorials and presentations about PyWhy libraries but also talks by external speakers working on causal inference.
