# The future of generative AI 


## Abstract

With their ability to generate human-like language and complete a variety of tasks, generative AI has the potential to revolutionise the way we communicate, learn and work. But what other doors will this technology open for us, and how can we harness it to make great leaps in technology innovation? Have we finally done it? Have we cracked AI?
Join Professor Michael Wooldridge for a fascinating discussion on the possibilities and challenges of generative AI models, and their potential impact on societies of the future. 
Michael Wooldridge is Director of Foundational AI Research and Turing AI World-Leading Researcher Fellow at The Alan Turing Institute. His work focuses on multi-agent systems and developing techniques for understanding the dynamics of multi-agent systems. His research draws on ideas from game theory, logic, computational complexity, and agent-based modelling. He has been an AI researcher for more than 30 years and has published over 400 scientific articles on the subject.
This lecture is part of a series of events - How AI broke the internet - that explores the various angles of large-language models and generative AI in the public eye.
This series of Turing Lectures is organised in collaboration with The Royal Institution of Great Britain.
