# Unlocking GenAI with GraphRAG & Knowledge Graphs

## Abstract


Recorded at the iconic Computer History Museum during the Ai Summit by TechEquity Ai on October 26th, 2024, This presentation offers a detailed exploration of why GraphRAG has emerged as one of the most promising techniques for getting GenAI from prototype to production.

If you ever brought an incredible GenAI application to prototype stage, but then struggled to get it over crossing the production finish line, you are not alone. Latest estimates are that more than two-thirds of GenAI projects get similarly stuck. Typical culprits range from hallucinations to lack of sufficient governance, including explainability and controls around data security and privacy. 

GraphRAG is a new technique that helps bridge these gaps that are so often necessary to overcome for higher-stakes applications. Join this session to learn how knowledge graphs are helping, what the fuss about GraphRAG is all about, and how to get started with your own GraphRAG application.

Philip Rathle is CTO of Neo4j, the graph database and analytics leader that enabled the ICIJ to crack the Panama Papers, and NASA to get to Mars two years faster. Neo4j enables thousands of organizations worldwide, including most of the Fortune 500, to solve their most pressing valuable problems through the power of the connections in data. Philip comes from a long career in data databases. He joined Neo4j in 2012, helping to pioneer the graph database category, and creating one of the world's leading database & analytics companies. He is the recent author of the GraphRAG Manifesto.
