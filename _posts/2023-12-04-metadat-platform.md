# The Modern Metadata Platform  

## Abstract

Recently there has been a lot of buzz in the data community on the topic of metadata management. It’s often discussed in the context of data discovery, data provenance, data governance, and data privacy. Even Gartner and Forrester have created the new Active Metadata Management and Enterprise Data Fabric categories to highlight the development in this area.

However, metadata management isn’t actually a new problem. It has just taken on a whole new dimension with the widespread adoption of the Modern Data Stack. What used to be a small, esoteric issue that only concerned the core data team has exploded into complex, organizational challenges that plagued companies large and small.

In this talk, we’ll explain how a Modern Metadata Platform (MMP) can help solve these new challenges and the key ingredients to building a scalable and extensible MMP.
