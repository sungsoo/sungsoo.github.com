## Decremental All-Pairs Shortest Paths in Deterministic Near-Linear Time



## Abstract

We study the decremental All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) problem in undirected edge-weighted graphs. The input to the problem is an undirected n-vertex m-edge graph *G* with non-negative lengths on edges, that undergoes an online sequence of edge deletions. The goal is to support approximate shortest-paths queries: given a pair *x, y* of vertices of *G*, return a path *P* connecting *x* to *y*, whose length is within factor α of the length of the shortest *x-y* path, in time *O(|E(P)|)*, where α is the approximation factor of the algorithm.
