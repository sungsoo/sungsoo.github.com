# Making Retrieval Augmented Generation Better


## Abstract

Join, Pinecone Developer Advocate, @jamesbriggs as he delves into retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and explores its role in enhancing Large Language Models (LLM) and chatbot applications. In this webinar, we'll explore the nuances RAG, the different ways that it can be applied, and the impact of each approach for augmenting language models and revolutionizing the capabilities of chatbots. This will provide a holistic understanding of how RAG can serve as a transformative force in GenAI.

James will also share invaluable insights into the intricacies of data preparation for RAG. Unearthing hidden gems in your dataset and optimizing it for retrieval augmentation is a crucial step in harnessing the full potential of this technology. You can expect to gain practical tips and tricks that will empower you to curate data that aligns seamlessly with your RAG pipelines.
