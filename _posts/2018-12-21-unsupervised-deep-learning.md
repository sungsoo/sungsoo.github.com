## Unsupervised Deep Learning

### Abstract

This tutorial Unsupervised Deep Learning will cover in detail, the approach to simply 'predict everything' in the data, typically with a probabilistic model, which can be seen through the lens of the Minimum Description Length principle as an effort to compress the data as compactly as possible.

Alex Graves is a research scientist at DeepMind. He did a BSc in Theoretical Physics at Edinburgh and obtained a PhD in AI under JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber at IDSIA. He was also a postdoc at TU Munich and under Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto.
