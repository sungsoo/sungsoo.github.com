# Forest-of-Thoughts; AI Test-Time Compute Reasoning

## Abstract

OpenAi o1 uses a long chain-of-thoughts reasoning structure for advanced reasoning capabilities during inference. We examine the next evolution of CoT, discuss the inner workings of Forest of Thoughts (FoT) and explore their transferability to smaller language models.
