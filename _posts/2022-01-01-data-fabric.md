# Data Fabrics for Enterprise Data Management?

## Abstract

*Gartner and Forrester started writing research articles about “data fabric” in 2020. Gartner listed it as one of the top ten trends and Forrester even published a Wave called “Enterprise Data Fabric.” So, what is a data fabric?

Gartner and Forrester have slightly differing definitions, but they both ultimately mean the same — knitting together disparate data irrespective of its location, format, or latency. And they advocate adding AI/ML on top of it.

Join us for this presentation about how to establish data fabric as an enterprise data management layer. The presenter will answer:

- How do Gartner and Forrester define data fabric?
- The two variants of data fabric — physical and logical. Which one is better?
- Why and how should you implement data fabric for enterprise data management?
- Are there examples of BFSI firms that have adopted this approach?
