# Spectral Graph Theory; Enter Linear Algebra

## Abstract

Spectral Graph Theory I: how linear algebra enters the picture, and the nonstandard inner product relevant for an irregular graph.  Lecture 13c of "CS Theory Toolkit": a semester-long graduate course on math and CS fundamentals for research in theoretical computer science, taught at Carnegie Mellon University.
