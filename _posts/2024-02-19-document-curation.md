# Document Curation for Retrieval Augmented Generation


## Abstract


This tutorial will demonstrate document curation with Cleanlab Studio.  Curating documents is critical for GenAI applications like retrieval augmented generation. For instance, to build a LLM-powered system that can answer employee questions by referencing documents across a company (or product onboarding questions by referencing the product documentation).

This feature is in private preview and will be generally available in Cleanlab Studio soon. Contact us get access to the private preview:  sales@cleanlab.ai
