# Choosing the Right Embedding Model, Chunking Strategy, and More


## Abstract


In this informative talk, Frank Liu, Head of AI & ML at Zilliz, dives into the practical aspects of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). 
He discusses the importance of choosing the right embedding model, chunking strategy, and more when building a RAG application. Frank also provides insights into vector databases and their role in handling unstructured data. Additionally, he offers a sneak peek into the future of vector databases and their potential applications beyond large language models. If you're interested in AI tools and want to learn best practices from industry experts, don't miss this talk! #AItools #RAG #VectorDatabases #ArtificialIntelligence #MachineLearning
