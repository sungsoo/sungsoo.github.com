## Abstract
Rapid urbanization poses social and environmental challenges. Addressing these issues effectively requires access to accurate and up-to-date 3D building models, obtained promptly and cost-effectively. Urban modeling is an interdisciplinary topic among computer vision, graphics, and photogrammetry. The demand for automated interpretation of scene geometry and semantics has surged due to various applications, including autonomous navigation, augmented reality, smart cities, and digital twins. As a result, substantial research effort has been dedicated to urban scene modeling within the computer vision and graphics communities, with a particular focus on photogrammetry, which has coped with urban modeling challenges for decades. This workshop is intended to bring researchers from these communities together. Through invited talks, spotlight presentations, a workshop challenge, and a poster session, it will increase interdisciplinary interaction and collaboration among photogrammetry, computer vision and graphics. We also solicit original contributions in the areas related to urban scene modeling.
