# OpenAI Embeddings and Vector Databases Crash Course



## Abstract

In this video we will explore how to create a Vector Database by creating embeddings using the OpenAI API and then storing them in SingleStore.

The first part of the video will cover how to create an embedding using just API requests with Postman. Then we will jump into Single Store and store these in a new database made specifically for vectors like this.
