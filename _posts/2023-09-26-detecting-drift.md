# How to evaluate and explore data drift in machine learning systems 

* Track: PyData: Machine Learning & Stats

## Abstract

When your ML model is in production, you might observe input data and prediction drift. In absence of ground truth, drift can serve as a proxy for the model performance. But how exactly to evaluate it? In this talk, I will give an overview of the possible approaches, and how to implement and visualize the results.
