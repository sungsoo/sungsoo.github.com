## Generalizing Convolutions for Deep Learning

### Abstract

Arguably, most excitement about deep learning revolves around the performance of convolutional neural networks and their ability to automatically extract useful features from signals. In this talk I will present work from AMLAB where we generalize these convolutions. First we study *convolutions on graphs* and propose a simple new method to *learn embeddings of graphs* which are subsequently used for *semi-supervised learning* and *link prediction*. We discuss applications to *recommender systems* and *knowledge graphs*. Second we propose a new type of convolution on regular grids based on group transformations. This generalizes normal convolutions based on translations to larger groups including the rotation group. Both methods often result in significant improvements relative to the current state of the art.

Joint work with Thomas Kipf, Rianne van den Berg and Taco Cohen.
