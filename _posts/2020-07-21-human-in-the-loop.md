# Efficient Deep Learning with Humans in the Loop

## Abstract
While deep learning produces supervised models with unprecedented predictive performance on many tasks, under typical training procedures, advantages over classical methods emerge only with large datasets. The *extreme data-dependence* of reinforcement learners may be even more problematic. Millions of experiences sampled from video-games come cheaply, but human-interacting systems can't afford to waste so much labor. In this talk I will discuss several efforts to increase the  labor-efficiency of learning from human interactions. Specifically, I will cover work on learning dialogue policies, *deep active learning* for natural language processing, learning from noisy singly-labeled data, and *active learning* with partial feedback.
