# Product quantization in Faiss and from scratch


## Abstract

In this video, we talk about a vector compression technique called Product quantization. We first explain conceptually, what the main ideas are and then show how one can use an existing implementation of it from Faiss (IndexPQ). Finally, we also implement the algorithm from scratch. Last but not least, we run some experiments and compare different methods.
