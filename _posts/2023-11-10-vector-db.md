## How to Choose a Vector Database in 2023

The discussion covers indexing algorithms, emphasizing HNSW and IVF, followed by an in-depth comparison of the vector databases. Finally, a practical example of using a vector database with DVC will be shown, to iterate on your vectors while using the same stack as in your production pipeline.

At the end of the presentation, you should have more clarity on selecting the right vector database based on individual requirements and technical infrastructure.
