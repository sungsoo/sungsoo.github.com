# Decoding the Human Brain – A Neurosurgeon’s Experience

* Pascal O. Zinn, MD, PhD, FAANS 

## Abstract

Dr. Zinn will discuss his experience leveraging state-of-the-art techniques for decoding the human brain during awake surgeries and complex brain tumor removals. Utilizing electrical brain stimulation, electrocorticography (ECoG) and advanced neuropsychological methods, Dr. Zinn and his team explore intricate conscious functions of the human brain in real-time. The team works in a concerted effort across disciplines to tailor this approach to each individual patient, designing the safest and most efficient surgical paradigms to maximize brain tumor removal while preserving essential functions such as speech, memory, and cognition/consciousness. His talk will focus on the latest advancements in neurosurgery and neuroscience, providing a unique glimpse into the intersection of medical innovation and technology on the man-machine interface in neurosurgery.
