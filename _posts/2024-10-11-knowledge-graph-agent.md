# Harvard Presents NEW Knowledge-Graph AGENT (MedAI)

## Abstract
Harvard Unveils New Knowledge Graph Agent for improved AI in Medicine. Called KGARevion, it combines the knowledge from knowledge graphs with the knowledge of LLMs.

Since RAG suffers from inaccurate and incomplete retrieval problems in medicine, Harvard et al present a new and improved methodology to significantly increase the reasoning performance of medical AI systems. Special focus on complex medical human interactions. 

New insights and new methods to combine the non-codified knowledge of LLMs with the structural codified knowledge of medical knowledge graphs. 

Detailed explanation of the new methods in this AI research pre-print (also for beginners in AI).
